# no-show-appointments
This project was completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree certification.
# Overview
The goal of this project is to investigate a dataset of appoinment records for Brasil public hospitals. The data includes some attributes of patients and state if the patients showed up to appointments. The analysis should be focused on finding trends influencing patients to show or not show up to appointments. Using descriptive statistics the following question should be answered: What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment? Predictive analytics is out of scope of this project.

The original problem description and data set can be found here:
# Details
I have looked into the dataset and managed a few problems like unifying names, removing wrong data, adding new features based on existing data. I have also investigated most of independent variables in the dataset and made a few observations comparing them to each other as well as to the dependent one (no_show). As this was only an exploratory analysis, many potential correlations may remain uncovered. The data should be investigated further with more advanced statistical analysis to potentially reveal new insights and correlations.

For details see analysis documentation Jupyter Notebook or HTML.

# Findings
after doing analysis the dataset i can answer those questions below:
1 Do patients who receive SMS messages have a higher rate of attendance to their appointments than others?

The patients that who did not receive SMS had a greater rate to show up than those who received SMS

2 Does a patient with diabetes have a higher attendance rate?

Diabetics who attend their appointments are higher than others

3 Does have a Handcap affect showing up the appointment?

Patients with Handcap will have a higher rate of attendance at the appointment

4 Does the age affect showing up the appointment?

Yes, because of no show having age more
